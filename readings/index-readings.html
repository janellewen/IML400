         <h3>WEEK ONE</h3>

        <p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/1997/06/19/aesthetics-of-t.html">Aesthetics of the Internet - Context as a Medium</a></p>
        <p>
        The importance of context over content really resonated with me. With the Internet, the ratio of archiving to searching is imbalanced. With the wealth of information on the web, it makes more sense for us to create structure and landscape for ourselves to navigate rather than to download and archive personally. We go through forums, communities and organized systems, such as our preferred search engines, to filter through and access information that we need. Though the article is only written in the early years of it’s creation, the chaotic amoeba that is the Internet is already described as a vibrant, breathing entity: “…the Internet is educated and formed, for better or for worse, into a product of its environment and society. Putting work on the Internet is more like giving birth than creating a static object.” With 20 years in existence, the Internet is so much more than before. It is comparable to traditional forms of media and communications (magazines, television, radio, etc.) and sometimes exceeds them. The Internet is dynamic and interactive and fosters connectivity and community. The web has gone so far to The “memetic engineer/Internet artist” focuses on “organiz[ing] [people, content, traffic, money, etc.] in a way that grows and adds value.” The creation based on context rather than content will continue on and evolve the Internet.

        Also, I found out that my spirit animal is a snake! The quiz said: "If the Snake is your spirit animal then you are being invited into easeful transition on all levels; mental, physical, emotional + spiritual. Trust that change is happening naturally with ease and grace because you are guided by the Snake." Solid.

          <h3>WEEK THREE</h3>

        <p><a href="http://bytezen.github.io/IML400/readings/berners-lee_et_al_the_world-wide_web.pdf">The World-Wide Web</a></p>
        <p> I began reading the article and upon reading the portion of describing how the highlighted or box lead calls the server to pull up information, etc. I thought to myself, <i>I wish there was some sort of visual,</i> because I couldn’t comprehend how this transaction of information was presented on the web, but then when I reached the image of the simple open browser windows and embedded hyperlinks I looked to see when the article was written. It was the year of my birth, 1994, and it dawned on me the complexity of the “W3” seemed so new and revolutionary that now, the practice of using it is second nature to internet users and is taken for granted. </p>

        <p> I thought it was unbelievable the volume of HTTP servers are now in contrast to the presented number of a thousand or so. The article foreshadowed some of the web’s developments as well as its problems. The accessibility of the internet (or rather lack there of), was a resonating note in the conclusion. They acknowledged the design goal of the Web: “being a pool of knowledge that is as easy to update as to read” (Berners-Lee, et. al. 798). It is always so humbling be reminded the noble purpose of the Web as free, immediate, and collaborative. I agree with the point that that goal was not fulfilled yet in terms of user experience. </p>

        <p> The “Future” that the article predicted was surprisingly accurate on some points. “More sophisticated document type definitions” has ben fulfilled with myriad aesthetic choices ranging from fonts to images to colors and layouts. Real-time features have manifested itself not only teleconferencing, but broadcasting, gaming, and document editing. Virtual reality is exponentially being developed and utilized in recent years. The Internet is also absolutely saturated with monetized content, from advertisements to videos and music. The future as they predicted is here.

        <p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">How Users Read on the Web</a> by Jakob Nielsen </p>

        <p>Lambrecht’s article really broke down what the difference between UX and UI. The metaphor of UI without UX being paint slapped on a canvas without plans and UX without UI being a frame without paper mache resonated with me. It brought be back to the foundation of what design is in the first place—form meeting function. Both are necessary and lean on each other for the design’s success to fulfill a purpose. The particular section describing how UX/UI are perceived based on job descriptions and postings is interesting because it tends to sway towards graphic design and front end development, and then others towards UX. The article clarified that neither of these directions are right and that it is UI’s role to transfer “a product’s development, research, content and layout into an attractive, guiding and responsive experience for users.” Even that is pretty broad, so it is no wonder that there are varying interpretations on the UI designer's role.</p>

        <p>In the Complete Beginner’s Guide article, It was interesting for me to read about UI because it involves design based on needs and wants and the interactions of the user based upon that. The part that resonated with me the most in the article is the section about the Five Dimensions, which make up interactions themselves, and result in the end communication with the user. </p>

        <p>Being a visual designer, often I only think of the one dimension of seeing, and other senses derive from that. In digital there are components of the design as well as the environment that I haven’t even considered: 1D, the words, 2D, the graphics, 3D, the physical hardware surrounding the screen and the device that the screen is a part of, 4D, the time and indicators of time that measures progress, and 5D, the emotions and reactions that the user has when interacting with the system. I appreciated that article a lot because it delves into further research at the end with prominent figures in the UX/UI community that I can follow and study. In addition, the site included tools and resources that could be used to make mockups and wireframes.</p>

        <p>The Mac Developer Library further talked about the design principles that may seen second nature, but when designing you must really think and analyze upon. I feel like being knowledgable in cognitive science and psychology would be most beneficial. I believe user control described in the article is a tricky thing because sophistication varies from audience to audience. When a user is prompted to go through superfluous steps to understand what to do, that can be extremely annoying, whereas the lost user that is given light instruction is confused and bewildered. </p>



             <h3>WEEK EIGHT</h3>

        <p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574318373312061230">The Internet as Art</a></p>
        <p>Goran Mijuk discusses new and innovative works developed on the web by artists all around world that are coveted by both the public and private collectors. The section that resonated with me was regarding the rogue nature of collaborative art spaces such as the mock-Wikipedia art page and thawed network www.picidae.net in which users from all over the world could contribute to. The wikipedia page wikipediaart.org seemed something I would be personally invested in because there is a lack of collaboration in the art and design community. Of course there are blogs and places of discussion, but not true collaboration, like editing and annotation other peoples works. The fact that the site was rejected by wikipedia.org for not “conforming to standards” is so ironically perfect because art really can’t be contained, and the web would be one of the best places to house it. I thought the network www.picidae.net for uploading images to evade official censorship. Art escapes the regulation of the Internet because it is made of pixels rather than code that can be picked up by machines. The collaboration on the can bring such valuable information that otherwise would be blocked.</p>

        <o>One of the media projects that is described in the article includes assisting the handicapped throughout the city by posting images of road obstacles from cameras around the city. I think art projects such as these are extremely valuable from the practicality of it as well as it’s inventiveness. Projects that evoke social action are important as well because they break the traditional way information is delivered by articles, or images, or video. The blend of media is unconventional and breaks through the saturated web. The next step would be having these projects more easily searchable and accessed through mainstream platforms such as social media, or search engines. More visibility will allow more users to create “new experiences and new courses of action,” as the article states.</p>

        <p>It is a difficult balance between accessibility and the art’s market value. The ubiquitous of the internet has warranted projects to be accessed by the public because of the nature of the medium, but it is difficult to sustain financially. I thought it was interesting how they introduced physicality into the art of web and how collectors indulged in the “physical specimens” of the work. There is still a heavy value on the tangible despite the innovation of art on the web.</p>
