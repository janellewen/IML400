        <h3>UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p>Hello there! I apologize, my pages are under construction. I will still put my work here while I up my aesthetics in secret! Will update soon.</p>

         <h3>WEEK ONE</h3>

        <p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/1997/06/19/aesthetics-of-t.html">Aesthetics of the Internet - Context as a Medium</a></p>
        <p>
        The importance of context over content really resonated with me. With the Internet, the ratio of archiving to searching is imbalanced. With the wealth of information on the web, it makes more sense for us to create structure and landscape for ourselves to navigate rather than to download and archive personally. We go through forums, communities and organized systems, such as our preferred search engines, to filter through and access information that we need. Though the article is only written in the early years of it’s creation, the chaotic amoeba that is the Internet is already described as a vibrant, breathing entity: “…the Internet is educated and formed, for better or for worse, into a product of its environment and society. Putting work on the Internet is more like giving birth than creating a static object.” With 20 years in existence, the Internet is so much more than before. It is comparable to traditional forms of media and communications (magazines, television, radio, etc.) and sometimes exceeds them. The Internet is dynamic and interactive and fosters connectivity and community. The web has gone so far to The “memetic engineer/Internet artist” focuses on “organiz[ing] [people, content, traffic, money, etc.] in a way that grows and adds value.” The creation based on context rather than content will continue on and evolve the Internet.

        Also, I found out that my spirit animal is a snake! The quiz said: "If the Snake is your spirit animal then you are being invited into easeful transition on all levels; mental, physical, emotional + spiritual. Trust that change is happening naturally with ease and grace because you are guided by the Snake." Solid.

          <h3>WEEK THREE</h3>

        <p><a href="http://bytezen.github.io/IML400/readings/berners-lee_et_al_the_world-wide_web.pdf">The World-Wide Web</a></p>
        <p> I began reading the article and upon reading the portion of describing how the highlighted or box lead calls the server to pull up information, etc. I thought to myself, <i>I wish there was some sort of visual,</i> because I couldn’t comprehend how this transaction of information was presented on the web, but then when I reached the image of the simple open browser windows and embedded hyperlinks I looked to see when the article was written. It was the year of my birth, 1994, and it dawned on me the complexity of the “W3” seemed so new and revolutionary that now, the practice of using it is second nature to internet users and is taken for granted. </p>

        <p> I thought it was unbelievable the volume of HTTP servers are now in contrast to the presented number of a thousand or so. The article foreshadowed some of the web’s developments as well as its problems. The accessibility of the internet (or rather lack there of), was a resonating note in the conclusion. They acknowledged the design goal of the Web: “being a pool of knowledge that is as easy to update as to read” (Berners-Lee, et. al. 798). It is always so humbling be reminded the noble purpose of the Web as free, immediate, and collaborative. I agree with the point that that goal was not fulfilled yet in terms of user experience. </p>

        <p> The “Future” that the article predicted was surprisingly accurate on some points. “More sophisticated document type definitions” has ben fulfilled with myriad aesthetic choices ranging from fonts to images to colors and layouts. Real-time features have manifested itself not only teleconferencing, but broadcasting, gaming, and document editing. Virtual reality is exponentially being developed and utilized in recent years. The Internet is also absolutely saturated with monetized content, from advertisements to videos and music. The future as they predicted is here.
