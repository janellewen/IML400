        <h3>UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p>Hello there! I apologize, my pages are under construction. I will still put my work here while I up my aesthetics in secret! Will update soon.</p>

         <h3>WEEK ONE</h3>

        <p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/1997/06/19/aesthetics-of-t.html">Aesthetics of the Internet - Context as a Medium</a></p>
        <p>
        The importance of context over content really resonated with me. With the Internet, the ratio of archiving to searching is imbalanced. With the wealth of information on the web, it makes more sense for us to create structure and landscape for ourselves to navigate rather than to download and archive personally. We go through forums, communities and organized systems, such as our preferred search engines, to filter through and access information that we need. Though the article is only written in the early years of it’s creation, the chaotic amoeba that is the Internet is already described as a vibrant, breathing entity: “…the Internet is educated and formed, for better or for worse, into a product of its environment and society. Putting work on the Internet is more like giving birth than creating a static object.” With 20 years in existence, the Internet is so much more than before. It is comparable to traditional forms of media and communications (magazines, television, radio, etc.) and sometimes exceeds them. The Internet is dynamic and interactive and fosters connectivity and community. The web has gone so far to The “memetic engineer/Internet artist” focuses on “organiz[ing] [people, content, traffic, money, etc.] in a way that grows and adds value.” The creation based on context rather than content will continue on and evolve the Internet.

        Also, I found out that my spirit animal is a snake! The quiz said: "If the Snake is your spirit animal then you are being invited into easeful transition on all levels; mental, physical, emotional + spiritual. Trust that change is happening naturally with ease and grace because you are guided by the Snake." Solid.
